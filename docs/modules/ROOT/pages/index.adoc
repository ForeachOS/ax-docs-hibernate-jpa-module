= Hibernate JPA support

*AcrossHibernateJpaModule* activates JPA support for the entire Across context.
It allows other module to subscribe their entities to the JPA `EntityManager` represented by the AcrossHibernateJpaModule.
The JPA implementation is built on top of Hibernate.
The module also activates support for Spring Data `JpaRepository` implementations and comes with a set of <<base-classes,helpers>> to facilitate repository implementations.

In an Across application with a single entity manager, adding AcrossHibernateJpaModule will serve as a drop-in replacement for the regular Spring Boot JPA starter in the application module.
