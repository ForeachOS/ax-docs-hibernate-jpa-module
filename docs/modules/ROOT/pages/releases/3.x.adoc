= 3.x.x release notes

[#3-1-0]
== 3.1.0.RELEASE
Bugfixes:
* The EntityManagerFactory of the primary AcrossHibernateModule is now exposed as a primary bean

[#3-0-0]
== 3.0.0.RELEASE
This version requires Across 3.0.0.
It is also a major update increasing compatibility with the Spring Boot JPA starter.

The default configuration now builds on top of Spring Boot JPA support.

.Naming strategy
Due to Spring Boot compatibility, the default naming strategy being used has been changed since the previous version: the default is now a Spring naming strategy, instead of a Hibernate one.
This can cause problems with query generation.

Some issues have been mentioned regarding reserved keywords (eg. as a table or column name).

You can manually revert to the previous naming strategy by setting: `acrossHibernate.hibernate.naming.physical-strategy=org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl`.

.List of changes
* when plugging a single AcrossHibernateJpaModule in an application it will transparently take over the starter JPA support on the application module
** the single exception is the default handling of schema creation in case of a memory database: standard Spring Boot will create the schema by default whereas AcrossHibernateJpaModule will not
* a `PlatformTransactionManager` is now always created
** the (largely unused) configuration property to disable the `PlatformTransactionManager` has been removed
* in addition a `TransactionTemplate` bean is now also created and exposed
* the AcrossHibernateJpaModule will mark its exposed beans as `@Primary` by default
** if you want another module to expose the primary beans, set the property `acrossHibernate.primary` to `false`
** a custom module (eg. extending AcrossHibernateJpaModule) works the opposite way: it will not expose primary beans unless the relevant property is explicitly set to `true` or it is the only module in the Across context
* several new <<module-settings,configurable properties>> have been added
** all `spring.jpa` and `spring.transaction` configuration properties will be respected, they can also be set directly using the `acrossHibernate` prefix
* it is now much easier to <<multiple-modules,create a separate AcrossHibernateJpaModule>> for an additional `EntityManager`
** using `AcrossHibernateJpaModule.builder()` a custom module can now also be created at runtime
** property handling for custom modules is much easier
* it's now also possible to specify packages to scan for entities by injecting an `@EntityScan` annotated class into the AcrossHibernateJpaModule
* fix compatibility with Spring Data which changes the signature of `JpaRepositoryFactoryBean`

NOTE: The original AcrossHibernateModule is still present but has officially been deprecated.
