= Helper classes and utilities

In addition to the bean infrastructure, this module also provides a set of base classes and general helpers to build a persistent domain model.

[#sequence-generator]
== AcrossSequenceGenerator
This is a `TableGenerator` that works cross-database and can be used to work with preset, negative id values.
Uses the `ACROSS_SEQUENCES` table created by the `AcrossSequencesInstaller` from Across core package.

	@Id
	@GeneratedValue(generator = "seq_mm_myentity_id")
	@GenericGenerator(
			name = "seq_mm_myentity_id",
			strategy = AcrossSequenceGenerator.STRATEGY,
			parameters = {
					@org.hibernate.annotations.Parameter(name = "sequenceName", value = "seq_mm_myentity_id"),
					@org.hibernate.annotations.Parameter(name = "allocationSize", value = "10")
			}
	)
	private Long id;
----

[#entity-base-classes]
== Entity base classes

`SettableIdBasedEntity` and `SettableIdAuditableEntity` classes are base classes for `@Entity` allowing an id to be set before persisting, using the `newEntityId` property.
The `SettableIdAuditableEntity` extension will automatically have auditing information updated when `SpringSecurityModule` is active and entity intercepting is enabled (default).

The `SettableIdBasedEntity` also implements common interfaces like `IdBasedEntity`, `Persistable` and `EntityWithDto`.
These are used by many other standard modules to automatically hookup functionality.
The base implementation is sufficient for many common use cases.

    	public Long getId() {
    		return id;
    	}

    	@Override
    	public void setId( Long id ) {
    		this.id = id;
    	}
    }

[#entity-dto-conversion]
=== DTO conversion
`SettableIdBasedEntity` supports converting an entity to a hibernate detached variant through `EntityWithDto#toDto` using `DtoUtils`.
The base implementation is a new instance of the object, to which all properties are copied over.

.Example entity with relationships
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	@Entity
    @Table(name = "acl_entity")
    public class MyEntity extends SettableIdAuditableEntity<MyEntity>
    {
    	@Id
    	@GeneratedValue(generator = "seq_mm_myentity.id")
    	@GenericGenerator(
    			name = "seq_mm_myentity",
    			strategy = AcrossSequenceGenerator.STRATEGY,
    			parameters = {
    					@org.hibernate.annotations.Parameter(name = "sequenceName", value = "seq_mm_myentity"),
    					@org.hibernate.annotations.Parameter(name = "allocationSize", value = "1")
    			}
    	)
    	private Long id;

    	@Column(name = "name")
    	private String name;

    	@JoinColumn(name = "my-other-entity")
    	private MyOtherEntity myOtherEntity;

    	// ...
    }
----
When performing `MyEntity#toDto` a new instance of `MyEntity` is created, and all of its properties are copied over.
This means,that when, for example, the name of the entity is modified, the changes will never be flushed to the database, unless an actual save is called with this new instance.
Depending on how modifications to the related entities are applied, such as `myOtherEntity` in the example, unintended changes can still be automatically flushed to the database, as it is copied over from the original instance.

A use case where this could happen is when a property of `myOtherEntity` is updated whilst the instance is still hibernate attached, and an application validation error occurs.
Functionally you will have blocked the update, but as the hibernate attached entity has been modified, the changes will still be flushed to the database at a certain point.
If there is no additional validation database wise, you might end up with an incorrect state.

To solve this, we've added a more advanced dto conversion using http://dozer.sourceforge.net/[Dozer].
When using the advanced dto conversion, a deep clone will be made of the entity, which means that related entities will also be hibernate detached.
When a property is configured as lazy loaded, the clone will instead insert a proxy, which will open a session and load the actual property when it is first called, and consequently create a deep clone of said property.

Activating the advanced dto conversion, can be done via the xref:configuration-properties.adoc[configuration properties].

=== Spring Data repository interfaces
`CommonJpaRepository` and `IdBasedEntityJpaRepository` are helper repository interfaces to help reduce boilerplate code.
`CommonJpaRepository` extends the basic `JpaRepository` with the `JpaSpecificationExecutor` interface.
`IdBasedEntityJpaRepository` is the extension tailored to `SettableIdBasedEntity` implementations that use a `Long` as id type.

Using these interfaces will ensure repository integration with other modules (for example `EntityModule`).

[#auditable-entities]
== Auditable entities

Any entity that implements the `Auditable<String>` interface will get auditing information set on every save or update.
`AuditableEntity` is a `@MappedSuperClass` that implements the `Auditable<String>` interface.
It adds auditing related columns: creation and last modification information (timestamp and principal).

=== AuditableSchemaInstaller

The `AuditableSchemaInstaller` is a base installer class that can easily be used to add the relevant auditing columns to multiple tables.

.Example entity with Auditable properties added
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----

@Entity
@Table(name = "customers")
public class Customer extends SettableIdAuditableEntity<Customer>
{
	@Id
	private Long id;

	@Column(name = "customerName")
	private String customerName;

}
----

.Equivalent AuditableSchemaInstaller to add the auditing columns in database
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
@Order(2)
@Installer(description = "Adds auditable columns to specific tables", version = 1)
public class MyAuditableInstaller extends AuditableSchemaInstaller
{
	@Override
	protected Collection<String> getTableNames() {
		return Collections.singleton( "customers" );
	}
}
----

Note the use of `@Order(2)` which might be necessary to ensure that your `AuditableSchemaInstaller` is run *after* running your base schema installer.

After starting your application, Across will automatically add the following columns to your entities:

|===
|Column |Type |Description

|created_by
|`String`
|The name of the principal that was creating the entity

|created_date
|`Date`
|The time at which the object was created

|modified_by
|`String`
|The name of the principal that was modifying the entity

|modified_date
|`Date`
|The time at which the object was modified

|
|===
